Title: To create a student registration form with HTML5 validation for name, email, and age inputs.

Approach:
This experiment focuses on creating a student registration interface using HTML and CSS. 

Steps:
1. First, I created a html file in visual studio code. 
2. Used basic html tags to make basic structure of webpage.
3. Then added a heading to display title of the form.
4. A form was created using <form> tag.
5. Input fields like student name, age, etc were added.
6. After completing the html structure, I created a CSS file to improve the appearance of the form.
7. The CSS file was then linked to the HTML by using the <link> tag.
8. Then tested the code by right click on the file -> Open with live server.
9. Then, I connected the github repository with vs code. 
10. At last, the project was succesfully deployed using netlify and verified.
